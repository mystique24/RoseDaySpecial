# RoseDaySpecial
Tried my hands on creating a website using HTML,CSS and JS to wish Roseday to dearones. It has used a part of code from fellow github users too.

There is a page on which you will hover and see a blooming rose. When you will click the rose it opens another page where you need to scratch and there is a hidden message.
